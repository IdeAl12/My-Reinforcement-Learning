* Reinforcement Learning
** The RL Problem
*** Sequential Decision Making
Goal: select actions to maximise total future reward

Actions may have long term consequences.

Reward may be delayed. It may be better to sacrifice immediate reward to gain more long-term reward.
*** Agent and Environment
**** At each step /t/ the agent:
*Executes action /A_t/

*Receives observation /O_t/

*Receives scalar reward /R_t/ 

**** The environment:
*Receives action /A_t/

*Emits observation /O_{t+1}/

*Emits scalar reward /R_{t+1}/ 
**** /t/ increments at env.tep
